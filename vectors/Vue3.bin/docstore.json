All properties are optional, but either a template or render function is required for the component to render.

For example, if you don't use the built-in `<Transition>` component, it won't be included in the final production bundle.

Global registration makes dependency relationships less explicit in large applications. It makes it difficult to locate a child component's implementation from a parent component using it. This can affect long-term maintainability similar to using too many global variables.\n\nLocal registration scopes the availability of the registered components to the current component only.

However, the difference is that **computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.** A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. This means as long as `author.books` has not changed, multiple access to `publishedBooksMessage` will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the getter function again.\n\nThis also means the following computed property will never update, because `Date.now()` is not a reactive dependency:\n\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n\n```js\ncomputed: {\n  now() {\n    return Date.now()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n\n```js\nconst now = computed(() => Date.now())","metadata":{"source":"/Users/marchorne/personal/monkey-labs-server/docs/guide/essentials/computed.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":168,"to":200}}}}],["779",{"pageContent":"</div>\n\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n\n```js\nconst now = computed(() => Date.now())\n```\n\n</div>\n\nIn comparison, a method invocation will **always** run the function whenever a re-render happens.\n\nWhy do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property `list`, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on `list`. Without caching, we would be executing `list`’s getter many more times than necessary!

This limitation is particularly prominent in components that need to deal with multiple **logical concerns**, which we have witnessed first hand in many production Vue 2 apps.\n\nTake the folder explorer component from Vue CLI's GUI as an example: this component is responsible for the following logical concerns:\n\n- Tracking current folder state and displaying its content\n- Handling folder navigation (opening, closing, refreshing...)\n- Handling new folder creation\n- Toggling show favorite folders only\n- Toggling show hidden folders\n- Handling current working directory changes","metadata":{"source":"/Users/marchorne/personal/monkey-labs-server/docs/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":60,"to":71}}}}],["964",{"pageContent":"The [original version](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/a09407dd5b9f18ace7501ddb603b95e31d6d93c0/packages/@vue/cli-ui/src/components/folder/FolderExplorer.vue#L198-L404) of the component was written in Options API.

Also, `.value` is easy to miss if not using a type system.\n\n[Vue Reactivity Transform](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity-transform) is a compile-time transform that allows us to write code like this:\n\n```vue\n<script setup>\nlet count = $ref(0)\n\nconsole.log(count)\n\nfunction increment() {\n  count++\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button @click=\"increment\">{{ count }}</button>\n</template>","metadata":{"source":"/Users/marchorne/personal/monkey-labs-server/docs/guide/extras/reactivity-transform.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":16,"to":35}}}}],["1015",{"pageContent":"The `$ref()` method here is a **compile-time macro**: it is not an actual method that will be called at runtime.

In addition, data fetching is done on the server-side for the initial visit, which likely has a faster connection to your database than the client. This generally results in improved [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) metrics, better user experience, and can be critical for applications where time-to-content is directly associated with conversion rate.\n\n- **Unified mental model**: you get to use the same language and the same declarative, component-oriented mental model for developing your entire app, instead of jumping back and forth between a backend templating system and a frontend framework.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/marchorne/personal/monkey-labs-server/docs/guide/scaling-up/ssr.md","loc":{"lines":{"from":15,"to":21}}}}],["1222",{"pageContent":"- **Better SEO**: the search engine crawlers will directly see the fully rendered page.\n\n  :::tip\n  As of now, Google and Bing can index synchronous JavaScript applications just fine.

That might mean deleting the first todo element, then adding it again at the end of the list.\n\nThe problem is, there are cases where it's important not to delete elements that will remain in the DOM. For example, you may want to use `<transition-group>` to animate list sorting, or maintain focus if the rendered element is an `<input>`. In these cases, adding a unique key for each item (e.g. `:key=\"todo.id\"`) will tell Vue how to behave more predictably.\n\nIn our experience, it's better to _always_ add a unique key, so that you and your team simply never have to worry about these edge cases.

In these cases, replace `users` with a new computed property that returns your filtered list (e.g. `activeUsers`).\n\n- To avoid rendering a list if it should be hidden (e.g. `v-for=\"user in users\" v-if=\"shouldShowUsers\"`).
